# Gridmaster AI: An Autonomous Connect 4 Robot.

This project was my final project for MIT's 6.4212 Robotic Manipulation course. In this project, I simulated a full-stack robotic system meant to serve as an autonomous Connect 4 playing robot. 

Gridmaster's simulation is done using Drake, a model-based robotics toolbox developed at MIT's Robot Locomotion Group.
